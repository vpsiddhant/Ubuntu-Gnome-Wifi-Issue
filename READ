if the Wfi driver for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Gnome stops working suddenly do the following steps:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source

sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source
(It still wont work because it will show this line)

Thgis means it is skipping 3.13.0-132-generic and building only for 3.19.0-80-generic

So now run this

sudo apt-get install linux-headers-3.13.0-132-generic
sudo apt-get remove bcmwl-kernel-source
sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source

It should work
